## Overview:
The goal of this project is to analyze the Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Data.

What question am I trying to answer?
The main question -

1. Predict if a loan will be foreclosed on in the future.

### Where did the data come from?
All of the data came from Fannie Mae's data housing [website]( https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/tools-applications/data-dynamics)
The data is broken up by quarters from 2000 through 2020. 

### How was the data sampled?
Data from 2017 to 2019 was used for this project.

### The data pipeline

1. Data Acquisition: Data downloaded from Fannie Mae in .csv format.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   * Getting a better understanding of data
   * Identifying various data patterns
   * Getting a better understanding of the problem statement

3. Data Preprocessing: 
   * Identify missing values and either eliminate those rows or fill them in
   * Determine if there are inconsistent values
   * Identify duplicated values
   * Feature aggregation if needed
   * Feature encoding

4. Save our clean file and get ready to start modeling.
